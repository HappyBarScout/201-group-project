        <h2>Bang Bang PDX</h2>
        <p>An underrated but great spot, Bang Bang comes from the same folks who bring you the fantastic Aalto Lounge happy hour, but this time it’s Thai-influenced. The food menu is full of tasty Thai drinking snacks, including curries and skewers, but our favorite is the phenomenal wings</p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Knock Back</h2>
        <p>The Knock Back encapsulates the idea that bars are primarily supposed to be fun neighborhood spots. There are plenty of great cocktails to choose from, and they’re $2 off during happy hour. Also, wines by the glass, draught beer, and an entire boiler maker menu is $1 cheaper, too, with well-drinks clocking in at $3. HH food includes brussels sprouts ($6), sliders ($4.50), and more, but what’s really great here is the vibe. It’s always a party, and you’re always welcome</p>

        <p>Interurban likes to blur the line between bar and restaurant, and serves equally well as both. For happy hour, select cocktails and house wines are just $5, and mugs of beer are available for $4. There’s a nice array of food options on the cheap, but the mini corn-dogs with fries and the much healthier option of grilled broccolini are both standouts at $5.</p>

Paley’s Place was the progenitor of our farm-to-table PacNW dining style, and remains a Portland institution. It’s pricey, but that’s why there’s happy hour, where you can sip fine French wine at $5 a glass while snacking on fried duck wings for $8, or get just a simple but exquisite hamburger for only $8.</p>
